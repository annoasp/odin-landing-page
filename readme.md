This is a small repo for the 2nd TOP project, Landing Page.

So far just the example images that we need to replicate in creating our web page, and also this readme which will be more descriptive of the project as things progress.

I'll also add some learnings once complete to see if there were any particular stumbling blocks, new things I've picked up in the process of making the site, and that sort of thing!

Step 1
Added Google's Roboto font using 'font-family' in style.css and a link in index.html's head. Also added Verdana as a web-safe option, and then sans-serif as a fallback. Inspecting the index.html in my browser shows Roboto being selected as wanted when I put some example text into the page.
