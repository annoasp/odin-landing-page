This is a small repo for the 2nd TOP project, Landing Page.

So far just the example images that we need to replicate in creating our web page, and also this readme which will be more descriptive of the project as things progress.

I'll also add some learnings once complete to see if there were any particular stumbling blocks, new things I've picked up in the process of making the site, and that sort of thing!

Step 1
Added Google's Roboto font using 'font-family' in style.css and a link in index.html's head. Also added Verdana as a web-safe option, and then sans-serif as a fallback. Inspecting the index.html in my browser shows Roboto being selected as intended when I put some example text into the page.

Step 2
Introduced the basic scaffolding for the page in the index.html in preparation for adding the flexboxes and more general styling.

I opted to split the page up into six sections: Header, Hero Section, Info Section, Quote, Call to Action, Footer. Each main section is then broken down into further divs, with appropriate classes in each case, which should allow enough specificity when it comes to styling the page.

I won't be adding any images, just sticking to the most basic design, but there are still containers there that could be used if/when any images were added in the future.
